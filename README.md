Supplementary material for "Evaluating Machine Learning Approaches to Predict the Energy Expenditure of Cross-National Preschool Children: A Study of Feature and Signal Processing Effects" by Hannah J. Coyle-Asbil, Mirko Brandes, Berit Brandes, Christoph Buck, Marvin N. Wright, Lori Ann Vallis

The models to predict the energy expenditure (EE) of preschool children from raw accelerometer data with machine learning are included in the directory models. Each file corresponds to one model for a specific accelerometer model, body position, and EE outcome. 

The code that was used to build the models, and calculate the features is located in the processing folder.
